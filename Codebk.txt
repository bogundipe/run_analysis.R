my run_analysis.R code runs as downloading, merging, and subsequently created maindata for analysis purposes.

Download data from the web was downloaded and extracted into a folder called UCI HAR Dataset

There are 28 available;

The code merge train & test data to create one data set
        X (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
        Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
        Subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
        Merged_Data (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

Extracted only the measurements on the mean and std to create TidyData 
        TidyData (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting Merged_Data, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
       
Appropriately labeled the data with descriptive variable names as follows;
        code column in TidyData renamed into activities
        All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
        All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
        All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
        All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
        All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
        All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

From the data set in step 4, created independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
        MainData (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
        write MainData into MainData.txt file by setting row.name to FALSE.
